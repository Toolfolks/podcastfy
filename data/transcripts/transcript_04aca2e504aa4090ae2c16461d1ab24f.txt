<Person2> <prosody rate="100%" pitch="high"> Oh, this is right up my alley! I'm  always on the hunt for  better ways to wrangle my tools.  What kind of storage solutions are we talking about? </prosody></Person2>
<Person1> <prosody rate="95%" pitch="medium"> Well, they've got everything from heavy-duty toolboxes to those handy backpacks on wheels.  They even have  <emphasis> McLaren F1</emphasis>  collaborations! Can you imagine? </prosody></Person1>
