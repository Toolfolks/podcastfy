Welcome to Steve Warbys Info Podcast - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast. It looks like we're diving into the world of tool storage with DEWALT today. Anyone who's ever used a screwdriver knows how important it is to keep your tools organized.
</Person1>

<Person2>
Absolutely!  It sounds like DEWALT has a system, or maybe even a few systems, to help with that.
</Person2>

<Person1>
Yeah, they have a bunch of different options, like backpacks, rolling tool bags, and even these heavy-duty storage systems called TOUGHSYSTEM and TSTAK. They even have some combo kits, which is cool. 
</Person1>

<Person2>
Combo kits?  Now that sounds intriguing. What all comes in those?
</Person2>

<Person1>
Well, it seems like they bundle different TOUGHSYSTEM and TSTAK components together. For example, they have one with a deep box, an organizer, and a mobile box all in one package. 
</Person1>

<Person2>
 So you'd get a bunch of different storage options that work well together? That's pretty clever.
</Person2>

<Person1>
Right? And they have a whole bunch of accessories too, like organizers, internal trays, and even a dolly for their TOUGHSYSTEM.  
</Person1>

<Person2>
A dolly?  I guess when you're talking about tools, things can get heavy!
</Person2>

<Person1>
Exactly! They even have workshop storage solutions, like racking systems, which seem pretty serious. 
</Person1>

<Person2>
Wow, it sounds like DEWALT really has thought of everything when it comes to tool storage!  
</Person2>

<Person1>
It seems like it. From small tool pouches to entire workshop setups, they've pretty much got you covered.  And that's it for today's episode on DEWALT's storage solutions.  Thanks for listening, and we'll catch you on the next episode of Steve Warbys Info Podcast.
