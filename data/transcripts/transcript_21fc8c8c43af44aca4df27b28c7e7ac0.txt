<Person1>  <prosody rate="100%" pitch="medium"> Well, they've got a bunch of different systems, like their <emphasis>TSTAK</emphasis>  and  <emphasis>TOUGHSYSTEM</emphasis> ranges. Seems like they're big on keeping things modular. You know, stackable boxes, tool organizers, even rolling tool chests. </Person1> 
<Person2>  <prosody rate="90%" pitch="x-low">Modular systems are key for organization.  But are we talking flimsy plastic here, or something a bit more... robust?</prosody>  </Person2>
<Person1> <prosody rate="100%" pitch="medium">  Ah, from what I see, DEWALT is all about durability.  They use tough materials, and some of their storage solutions are even IP54 rated, meaning they're dust and water-resistant. </Person1>

<Person1> <prosody rate="90%" pitch="medium">For sure. And they have options for every type of job, from small backpacks to large rolling toolboxes. </Person1>
<Person2>  <prosody rate="90%" pitch="x-low">Got it. So whether you're a weekend warrior or a seasoned pro, DEWALT has a storage solution to keep your tools organized and protected. Thanks for the rundown! </prosody>  </Person2>
