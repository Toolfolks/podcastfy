<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium"> Welcome to Steve Warbys Info Podcast  - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast. Today, we're diving deep into the world of tool storage with, you guessed it, DeWalt! They've got a whole lineup to keep your <emphasis>screwdrivers</emphasis> and <emphasis>saws</emphasis> in check.  </prosody> </Person1>
<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  DeWalt, huh?  I've heard their storage solutions are pretty heavy-duty, just like their tools. What kind of stuff are we talking about here? </prosody> </Person2>
<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  Oh, you know, the works.  We've got backpacks for the mobile worker, rolling tool bags for, well, rolling your tools around.  They've even got these cool "TSTAK" boxes. They interlock and everything! </prosody> </Person1>
<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  TSTAK? Sounds like a snack pack for tools.  Are those for lighter loads? I'm imagining lugging around a jackhammer.  Probably not gonna cut it, right?  </prosody> </Person2>
<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  Hah!  That's a funny thought.  You might need a bigger box for that.  But yeah, the TSTAK system is more for organization and smaller tools.  Though they do mention an IP54 rating... maybe some of them ARE tough enough for heavier stuff.  </prosody> </Person1>
<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  IP54, huh?  Sounds intense!  But speaking of intense, what about workshop storage?  DeWalt's gotta have something for us folks who like to keep things, shall we say, *stationary*.  </prosody> </Person2>
<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  They do, they do!  They've got these TOUGHSYSTEM workshop racks.  Imagine those heavy-duty metal shelves you see in, like, a mechanic's shop.  That's the vibe.  </prosody> </Person1>
<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  Okay, now we're talking!  Sounds like DeWalt has all the bases covered, whether you're a weekend warrior or a seasoned pro. Thanks for the rundown!  </prosody> </Person1>
<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">  You got it! And with that, we've reached the end of our tool storage journey with DeWalt. Until next time, keep those tools organized and your projects running smoothly!  </prosody> </Person1>
